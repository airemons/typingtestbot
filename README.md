# typingtestbot
So, I made a bot for the website https://typingtest.com/. I know it's kinda dumb but I'm not that good, leave me alone!

Also, this currently only supports Windows 10 with Personalization Settings set to this colour (default) : - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hRnGSOTLAvyqW8CyIl6hyVGLvaXciw3t/view?usp=sharing'
The theme (dark or light) doesn't matter.
Also, for some reason, the compiled .exe file doesn't work unless run as administrator (at least for me). If you feel paranoid doing that just use python to run it.

NOTE : for the .py script to run you will need to install pyautogui (pip install pyautogui).

You must install Google Chrome for this to work (but I'm pretty sure everyone already has chrome installed)

I am working on this for linux. Will hopefully come out tommorow.
